`Ass1_Foundations/Ass1.rmd` and `Ass1_Foundations/Ass1.pdf` are the answer files

Everyone do all the tasks individually, then we make presentation together later

## TODO

* Ex 1 [x]
* Ex 2
    - a [x]
    - b [x]
    - c [\]
    - d [ ]
* Ex 3 [ ]
* Ex 4 [ ]

## Notes

* Look over task 1, especially task 1 d and see if it is done correctly according to instructions
* Task E2_a_5 smoothing operation to see ca avg looks bad, fix later
* Wind_Bearing Degrees quantative nominal or ordinal? I think nominal for now, even though they are all whole numbers
* Task E2_b_2 done slopply, has to be a better way to do this, removed many variables, not sure if allowed, check later


## Deadlines
