* Ex 3 [ ]
    - a [\\]
    - b [ ]
    - c [ ]
* Ex 4 [ ]

## Notes

* Look over task 1, especially task 1 d and see if it is done correctly according to instructions
* Task E2_a_5 smoothing operation to see ca avg looks bad, fix later
* Wind_Bearing Degrees quantative nominal or ordinal? I think nominal for now, even though they are all whole numbers
* Task E2_b_2 done slopply, has to be a better way to do this, removed many variables, not sure if allowed, check later
* Task E2_c justification for hypothesis tests very weak, write better later
