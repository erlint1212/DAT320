# Exercise 1

## Task 1

The following code block serves as example on writing R markdown documents.

```{r ex1_task1}
# loading necessary packages
library(ggplot2)

d = data.frame(time = 1:100, param = (1:100)^2) # defining a data.frame d
ggplot(d, aes(x = time, y = param)) + # a simple plot
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
```

Don't forget to provide explanations with your results.

## Task 2

You may reuse variables and packages you have defined in earlier code blocks:

```{r ex1_task2}
str(d)
```

## Task 1

You may use LaTeX notation within R markdown as well:

$$ \text{acf}(.) = \text{cor}(x_t, B^k(x_t)) $$
