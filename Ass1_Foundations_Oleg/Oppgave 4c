Oppgave 4c:
Yes, the property of correlation regarding scaling holds for partial correlation as well.
Just like regular correlation, partial correlation is not affected by scaling of the variables, only the direction or sign can change.
Let's do the math so see how this is the case:

1.
In the partial correlation formula we have:
    Pxy
    Pxz
    Pyz

2.
if we then scale the x and y variables with a1 and a2 we get:
    Pxy = sgn(a1,a2)*Pxy
    Pxz = sgn(a1)*Pxz
    Pyz = sgn(a2)*Pyz

3.
Then we substitute the coefficients with the scaled ones and obtain the formula:
Pxy|z = (Pxy - Pxz*Pyz) / (sqrt(1-(Pxz)^2)*sqrt(1-(Pyz)^2) -> (sgn(a1,a2)*Pxy - sgn(a1)*Pxz*sgn(a2)*Pyz) / (sqrt(1-(sgn(a1)*Pxz)^2)*sqrt(1-(sgn(a2)*Pyz)^2)

4.
after doing the math and simplifying the formula we obtain sgn(a1,a2)*Pxy|z
